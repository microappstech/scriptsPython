It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.&rdquo;
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.&rdquo;
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.&rdquo;
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.&rdquo;
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.&rdquo;
Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.&rdquo;
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.&rdquo;
Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.&rdquo;
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.&rdquo;
Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.&rdquo;
You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.&rdquo;
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.&rdquo;
Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others.&rdquo;
Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis.&rdquo;
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. &rdquo;
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.&rdquo;
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.&rdquo;
Be Brave and Take Risks: You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.&rdquo;
No matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want. Here’s a short list of people who accomplished great things at different ages
Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.&rdquo;
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.&rdquo;
Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.&rdquo;
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.&rdquo;
It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.&rdquo;
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.&rdquo;
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.&rdquo;
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.&rdquo;

No matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want. Here’s a short list of people who accomplished great things at different ages
Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.&rdquo;
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.&rdquo;
Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.&rdquo;
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.&rdquo;
It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.&rdquo;
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.&rdquo;
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.&rdquo;
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.&rdquo;
Keep Going
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.&rdquo;
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.&rdquo;
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.&rdquo;
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.&rdquo;
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.&rdquo;
Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.&rdquo;
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.&rdquo;

Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.&rdquo;

You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.&rdquo;

Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.&rdquo;
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.&rdquo;
Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.&rdquo;
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.&rdquo;
It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.&rdquo;
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.&rdquo;
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.&rdquo;
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.&rdquo;
Keep Going
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.&rdquo;
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.&rdquo;
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.&rdquo;
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.&rdquo;
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.&rdquo;
Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.&rdquo;
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.&rdquo;
Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.&rdquo;
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.&rdquo;
Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.&rdquo;
You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.&rdquo;
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.&rdquo;
Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others.&rdquo;
Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis.&rdquo;
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. &rdquo;
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.&rdquo;
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.&rdquo;

It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.&rdquo;
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.&rdquo;
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.&rdquo;
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.&rdquo;
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.&rdquo;
Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.&rdquo;
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.&rdquo;
Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.&rdquo;
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.&rdquo;
Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.&rdquo;
You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.&rdquo;
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.&rdquo;
Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others.&rdquo;
Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis.&rdquo;
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. &rdquo;
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.&rdquo;
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.&rdquo;
Be Brave and Take Risks: You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.&rdquo;
No matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want. Here’s a short list of people who accomplished great things at different ages
Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.&rdquo;
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.&rdquo;
Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.&rdquo;
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.&rdquo;
It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.&rdquo;
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.&rdquo;
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.&rdquo;
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.&rdquo;

No matter how old you are now. You are never too young or too old for success or going after what you want. Here’s a short list of people who accomplished great things at different ages
Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.&rdquo;
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.&rdquo;
Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.&rdquo;
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.&rdquo;
It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.&rdquo;
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.&rdquo;
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.&rdquo;
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.&rdquo;
Keep Going
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.&rdquo;
Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.&rdquo;
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.&rdquo;
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.&rdquo;
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.&rdquo;
Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.&rdquo;
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.&rdquo;

Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.&rdquo;

You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.&rdquo;
